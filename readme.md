Experience API Design Pattern for Modernized Banking Architecture
I'll create a comprehensive design pattern for Experience APIs in a modernized banking architecture, addressing the key challenges and requirements you've outlined.
Problems

Journey Fragmentation: Mobile and web applications must make multiple API calls to different channel APIs to complete a single user journey, creating inefficiency and poor user experience.
Security Inconsistency: Varying security controls across channels create vulnerabilities and compliance gaps.
Business Logic Duplication: The same business logic is redundantly implemented across different client channels.
Misplaced Orchestration: Orchestration logic resides in channel layers rather than in the appropriate Process API layer.
High Client Complexity: Clients bear the burden of coordinating multiple backend services, increasing frontend complexity.
Lack of Standardization: Inconsistent API design across channels makes development, maintenance, and monitoring difficult.
Channel-specific Implementation: Business capabilities are tied to specific channels, preventing reusability.

Context
Modern banking operates in a multi-channel ecosystem where customers expect seamless experiences across mobile apps, web portals, branch services, and emerging interfaces. Legacy banking infrastructures typically developed channel-specific solutions, creating silos that impede digital transformation.
The bank operates internationally with diverse core banking systems supporting various domains (CASA, deposits, investments, loans, cards, payments). Each client interface (mobile, web) operates with its own channel layer, leading to redundancy, increased complexity, and higher maintenance costs.
API-led connectivity aims to transform this architecture by organizing APIs into three distinct layers:

System APIs: Connect to core banking systems and expose basic functionality
Process APIs: Implement business logic and orchestrate System APIs
Experience APIs: Provide channel-specific interfaces optimized for client experiences

This pattern focuses specifically on the Experience API layer design to create a more efficient, secure, and streamlined architecture.

Solution
The Experience API (EAPI) design pattern introduces a unified interface layer that serves as a façade between client applications and backend processes. The EAPI aggregates, orchestrates, and transforms data from multiple Process APIs to provide a cohesive and optimized interface for specific client experiences.

Define Experience APIs around complete journeys rather than discrete operations
Prioritize implementation based on journey frequency and business impact


Domain-Driven Structure

Organize Experience APIs by business domain (payments, accounts, investments)
Apply consistent naming conventions within domains
Implement domain-specific validation and business rules

Pattern Control Domain
The Experience API pattern operates within the "Digital Channels Control Domain" which encompasses all customer-facing interfaces. It interfaces with:

Frontend Control Domain: Mobile apps, web applications, and other client interfaces
Process Control Domain: Business process orchestration and rules engine
System Control Domain: Core banking systems and external services
Security Control Domain: Identity providers and authorization services
Data Control Domain: Data persistence and analytical services

Pattern Layer
The Experience API pattern applies specifically to the Experience layer of the API-led connectivity architecture. It sits above the Process and System API layers, serving as the interface between client applications and backend services.

Rationale
This Experience API design pattern represents the optimal approach for the following reasons:

Journey Centricity: By focusing on complete user journeys rather than isolated operations, the pattern aligns with how customers interact with banking services.
Separation of Concerns: The pattern clearly separates channel-specific concerns (Experience layer) from business logic (Process layer) and system integration (System layer).
Reusability: Process APIs can be reused across multiple Experience APIs, reducing redundancy and improving maintainability.
Scalability: The layered architecture allows each component to scale independently based on demand.
Security Consistency: Centralized security controls ensure uniform protection across all channels.
Flexibility: The pattern accommodates both current and future channels without requiring changes to underlying business logic.
Operational Efficiency: Consolidated monitoring and management reduce operational overhead.
