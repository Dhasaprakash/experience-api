To define clear, non-overlapping **principles** for your **Global Data Platform (GDP)**, **ODS**, and **Fast Data Store (FDS)**, we need to delineate their **purpose, data latency, use cases, consumers, and design constraints**. Below is a proposed set of **principles** and **responsibility boundaries** for each of the three layers, ensuring standardization without conflict.

---

## üß± **Global Data Platform (GDP)** ‚Äî *Trusted T+2 Analytical Platform*

### üîπ Purpose:

To serve as the **consolidated analytical layer** for all **T+2 and historical data** needs across the enterprise, enabling **reporting, BI, ML training, regulatory compliance**, and **downstream data provisioning**.

### ‚úÖ Principles:

* **Single Source of Truth for Analytical Data**: All strategic, reconciled, T+2 data resides here; no other platform should duplicate this responsibility.
* **Curated & Auditable**: Data should be traceable to source systems with lineage, transformation logic, and control points for regulatory and internal audit purposes.
* **Data Products as Assets**: Organize data into certified products with business ownership.
* **High Quality & Governed**: Ensure data stewardship, metadata cataloging, and data quality checks.
* **Batch Oriented**: Supports SLA-bound T+2 (or T+n) batch pipelines, not real-time ingestion.

### üéØ Use Cases:

* Regulatory & financial reporting
* Historical trend analysis
* ML model training on historical data
* Business dashboards and BI tools
* Data sharing with downstream systems (e.g., risk engines, finance, operations)

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Operational Data Stores (ODS)** ‚Äî *Client-Serving Operational Layer*

### üîπ Purpose:

To provide **clean, near-real-time static data** (e.g., customer, product, accounts) to **operational systems** such as IVR, CRM, portals, and branch systems.

### ‚úÖ Principles:

* **Latency-Optimized for Operational Readiness**: Data is processed in near-real-time or micro-batches, but not designed for complex analytics.
* **Read-Optimized Views**: Denormalized or pre-aggregated for rapid access with minimal transformation logic.
* **Static or Slowly Changing Data**: No support for fast-moving transactional events (delegated to FDS).
* **Not a Historical Store**: Keeps current state; history maintained only as needed for servicing.
* **Purpose-Bound Access**: Strictly scoped for customer-facing, operational tools only.

### üéØ Use Cases:

* CRM view of customer profiles
* IVR/Branch servicing
* Client onboarding validations
* Account/product lookup

---

## ‚ö° **Fast Data Store (FDS)** ‚Äî *Real-Time Event-Driven Intelligence*

### üîπ Purpose:

To **capture, process, and react to real-time data streams**, enabling **immediate insights** and **actions** (fraud detection, alerts, personalization, etc.).

### ‚úÖ Principles:

* **Real-Time & Event-Driven**: Supports millisecond to second-level latency using event streaming technologies (e.g., Kafka, Pulsar, Flink).
* **Stateless & Stateful Processing**: Uses both CEP (complex event processing) and contextual state where required (e.g., for client 360 aggregation).
* **Ephemeral by Design**: Not a long-term store; data is transformed into consumable insights/products and handed off to other systems.
* **Compute Close to Event**: Designed for low-latency compute near data ingress point (e.g., fraud rules running in stream).
* **Serves Action-Oriented Consumers**: Used by fraud engines, personalization engines, real-time dashboards.

### üéØ Use Cases:

* Fraud detection using transaction streams
* Real-time Client 360 aggregation
* Event-based triggers and alerts (KYC changes, login attempts)
* AUM calculations based on live trades

üî∑ 2. Component-Wise Breakdown
üîπ A. Event Producers (Sources)
Core Banking Systems (via CDC tools like Debezium or GoldenGate)

Channels (Mobile, Internet Banking, ATM)

Transaction switches (ISO 8583 or ISO 20022)

External systems (AML, payments, trade platforms)

‚úÖ Key Considerations:

Low-latency capture

Idempotent event formats (e.g., Avro/Protobuf)

Enrichment at source if possible (customer ID, device fingerprint, etc.)

üîπ B. Ingestion & Streaming Layer
Event Broker: Apache Kafka / Confluent / Amazon MSK / Pulsar

Schema Registry: Manage schemas using Avro/Protobuf

Ingestion Pipelines: CDC connectors, Kafka Connect, custom producers

‚úÖ Design Notes:

Partitioning strategy (customer_id, txn_id)

Topic-level retention policies (short for ephemeral events, longer for replayability)

Kafka Connect for CDC ingestion from RDBMS (for joining transactional + reference data)

üîπ C. Real-Time Stream Processing Engine
Engines: Apache Flink / ksqlDB / Spark Structured Streaming / Kafka Streams

Use Cases:

Fraud Detection: Stateful joins, pattern detection, blacklists

Client 360 Aggregation: Joins from multiple streams, maintain state per client

AUM Calculation: Streaming aggregation of investments by product and client

‚úÖ Design Strategies:

Sliding and tumbling windows for time-sensitive logic

Stateful operators backed by RocksDB or Flink state backend

Out-of-order event handling (watermarks)

Broadcast joins for reference data (e.g., customer risk profile)

üîπ D. Fast Data Store (Serving Layer)
Low-latency Stores:

Key-value: Redis, ScyllaDB, Aerospike

Document: MongoDB for semi-structured profile storage

Optional: Pinot / Druid for OLAP-style low-latency aggregations

‚úÖ Data Format & Design:

Row-level updates (mutable store)

Customer-centric schemas (client_id, profile, event log)

TTL policies for ephemeral stores (for fraud signals)

üîπ E. Consumers / Serving APIs
Real-Time Fraud Engine (consume enriched streams)

Personalization engine for app/web

Client 360 Dashboard (read from MongoDB / Redis)

Real-time alerting (via API or Kafka topic sink)

‚úÖ Tools:

RESTful APIs / GraphQL

Kafka sinks to notify downstream apps

Webhooks or push-based events

üîπ F. Data Governance, Monitoring, and Observability
Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry (stream lag, processing time)

Alerting: Custom thresholds for stream processing failures or high-latency

Lineage & Audit:

Track source ‚Üí topic ‚Üí transformation ‚Üí output

Integration with metadata systems (e.g., Apache Atlas, DataHub)

Security:

Row-level security on APIs

Encrypted topics, tokenized data (PII masking)

üîπ G. Optional Sync to Downstream Systems
Periodically sync aggregated data or snapshots to:

Global Data Platform (GDP) via batch

ODS (for current snapshot views)

Data Lake for archiving
