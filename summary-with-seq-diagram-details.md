# Banking Home Page Experience API Solution

Based on the design pattern document, I'll provide a generic solution description and a detailed sequence diagram for the Banking Home Page use case.

## Solution Overview

The Banking Home Page Experience API solution creates a unified facade that aggregates data from multiple Process APIs into a cohesive, personalized view for customers accessing their banking home page. This approach eliminates multiple API calls from client applications, improves performance, ensures consistent security, and enables segment-specific experiences for retail and affluent banking customers.

### Key Components:

1. **Segment-Specific Adapters**: Customize content density and prioritization based on customer segment (retail vs. affluent)

2. **Orchestration Engine**: Coordinates parallel calls to Process APIs (Accounts, Transactions, Offers, Notifications)

3. **Response Aggregator**: Combines data into a unified view model optimized for client display

4. **Cache Manager**: Implements multi-level caching with appropriate invalidation strategies

5. **Security Layer**: Provides consistent authentication and authorization across channels

### Key Benefits:

- Reduces client complexity from 5-8 API calls to a single call
- Improves performance through server-side parallelization and caching
- Delivers consistent experiences across channels
- Enables segment-specific personalization without client changes
- Creates foundation for advanced personalization and AI-driven insights

Let me create a detailed PlantUML sequence diagram showing the interactions between components.

## Detailed Component Responsibilities

The sequence diagram illustrates how the different components interact to deliver a unified home page experience. Let me explain the key responsibilities of each component:

### 1. Authorization and User Context (Purple)
- **Identity & Access Management**: Validates OAuth tokens, extracts user claims, and verifies permissions
- **Home Page Experience API**: Determines user segment (retail/affluent) based on authentication context

### 2. Segment-Specific Adaptation (Orange)
- **Segment Adapter**: Configures view models and personalization rules specific to user segment
- Applies different information density and prioritization rules for retail vs. affluent customers

### 3. Caching (Teal)
- **Cache Manager**: Checks for existing cached data before making backend calls
- Implements multi-level caching with segment-specific TTL policies
- Updates cache with fresh data and sets appropriate invalidation triggers

### 4. Orchestration (Yellow)
- **Orchestration Engine**: Coordinates parallel calls to multiple Process APIs
- Implements timeout handling and circuit breaker patterns
- Manages partial failures with graceful degradation

### 5. Data Aggregation (Red)
- **Response Aggregator**: Combines data from multiple sources into a unified view model
- Resolves conflicts between data sources
- Applies transformations to match client display requirements
- Formats response structure according to segment-specific rules

### 6. Process APIs (Light Blue)
- **Account Process API**: Provides account balances and details
- **Transaction Process API**: Delivers recent transaction history
- **Offer Process API**: Returns personalized marketing offers
- **Notification Process API**: Supplies relevant user notifications

## Implementation Considerations

1. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Implement critical path processing for essential components
   - Set appropriate timeouts for non-critical components
   - Use distributed caching with event-based invalidation

2. **Resilience Patterns**:
   - Apply circuit breakers for backend service calls
   - Implement fallback strategies for component failures
   - Design graceful degradation for partial data availability

3. **Segment-Specific Features**:
   - Include relationship manager details for affluent customers
   - Provide market insights for investment-focused customers
   - Adjust information density based on segment preferences

4. **Security Implementation**:
   - Ensure field-level encryption for sensitive data
   - Implement entitlement-based data filtering
   - Apply data minimization principles

This solution transforms the banking home page experience by moving complexity from the client to the server while enabling personalization, improving performance, and setting the foundation for advanced features like AI-driven insights.
